    title: `MAKING THE TRANSITION`,
    content: `Back in May of 2023, I finally moved from sales and
    management to follow my dream of becoming a Software Engineer. I started
    off with Harvard CS50 and immediately knew I'd made the right decision. 
    My passion for learning new skills led me to sign up for the full time
    boot camp program I completed in early November. Since the completion
    of the course, I've continued to hone my skills through ongoing collaboration
    on Blurb, a social media project some of my fellow boot camp grads and I created 
    for our final project!`
